# OpenCodeLaw YAML Schema Explanation

The OpenCodeLaw YAML schema defines the structure of the constitution for the organization. This schema provides a clear and organized way to outline various sections, articles, and amendments of the constitution. Here's a breakdown of each key in the schema:

## OpenCodeLaw

The root level key, `OpenCodeLaw`, specifies the version of the schema being used. In this case, it's `1.0.0`.

## info

The `info` section contains general information about the organization, including its title, terms of service URL, logo details, contact information, license, and version.

- `title`: The title of the organization.
- `termsOfService`: The URL to the terms of service for the organization.
- `logo`: Information about the organization's logo, including URL and alt text.
- `contact`: Contact details for inquiries, including name, URL, and email.
- `license`: The license under which the constitution is released.
- `version`: The version of the constitution.

## preamble

The `preamble` section contains the preamble of the constitution. It includes the title, content, and the date on which it was adopted.

- `title`: The title of the preamble.
- `content`: The content of the preamble, typically providing an introduction to the organization's purpose and values.
- `adopted`: The date on which the preamble was adopted.

## articles

The `articles` section outlines the different articles within the constitution. Each article has a title and content.

- `title`: The title of the article.
- `content`: The content of the article, which describes its purpose and regulations.
- `sections` (optional): If an article has sections, they can be defined here. Each section has a title and content, similar to articles.

## amendments

The `amendments` section lists any amendments made to the constitution over time. Each amendment has a title, reference to the article it modifies, and its content.

- `title`: The title of the amendment.
- `article`: The article to which the amendment is applied.
- `section` (optional): If an amendment is specific to a section within an article, it can be specified here.
- `content`: The content of the amendment, describing the changes made.

## Usage

To create a constitution, use this YAML schema as a template. Replace placeholder content with your organization's details, including titles, content, dates, and URLs.
