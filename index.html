            We, the members of "Service to Mankind," registered under the
            Telangana Societies Act, 2001 with registration number 111 of 2023,
            come together with a shared vision to make a positive impact on
            society. Guided by a deep commitment to social welfare, justice, and
            humanitarian values, we hereby establish this constitution to govern
            our mission and actions. With an unwavering dedication to the
            betterment of humanity, we strive to empower the marginalized,
            uplift the downtrodden, and bring hope to the lives of those in
            need. Recognizing our responsibility towards creating positive
            change, we pledge to work relentlessly to improve education, health,
            environmental sustainability, and social well-being. Embracing the
            principles of compassion, equality, and community, we seek to create
            an environment of collaboration, mutual respect, and inclusivity.
            Our aim is to bridge gaps and dissolve barriers, regardless of
            caste, creed, gender, or socio-economic background. Drawing
            inspiration from the rich legacy of service to mankind, we hold
            ourselves accountable to the highest ethical standards and
            transparency. Our mission is to be a beacon of hope, a catalyst for
            positive transformation, and a force that drives lasting change in
            society. As witnesses to this shared commitment, we adopt and enact
            this constitution to serve as the bedrock of our journey, ensuring
            that our actions align with our vision and values.
