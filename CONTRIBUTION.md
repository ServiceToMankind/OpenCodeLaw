# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Before you start, please read the following guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Stylesheet Compilation

We are using `style.scss` as our main stylesheet. To compile SCSS into CSS, follow these steps:

1. **Install Live Sass Compiler:**
   Make sure you have "Live Sass Compiler" installed in your development environment. You can install it using Visual Studio Code or any other compatible code editor extensions marketplace.

2. **Compile `style.scss`:**
   Configure your Live Sass Compiler to compile `style.scss` into `style.css`. Please ensure that you do not modify `style.css` directly. All your changes should be made in `style.scss`.

## JavaScript Changes

All script changes, additions, or modifications must be done in `js/opencodelaw.js` file. Please refrain from scattering scripts across multiple files for better code organization and maintainability.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
